Execute this command (if you already have an SSH key, you can skip this step):

ssh-keygen
Then you'll need to copy the new key to your server:

ssh-copy-id user@host
## or if your server uses custom port no:
ssh-copy-id "user@host -p 1234"
After the key is copied, ssh into the machine as normal:

ssh user@host
You can now login without entering a password from the particular machine you executed the commands at.
